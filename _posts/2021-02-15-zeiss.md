I was invited to chair the image processing session and to give a talk to the Virtual Correlative Microscopy Symposium, organised by Zeiss in collaboration with the Francis Crick Institute, the VIB Ghent and the EMBL Heidelberg. This symposium is a recuuring event, entitled From 3D Light to 3D Electron Microscopy.
