Every two years, an EMBO course is organized on CLEM at room temperature, at EMBL Heidelberg, and where I teach Ec-CLEM.

With Martin Schorb, we give introduction to the theoritical concepts behind registration, and I run a hands on practical on ec-clem, where student can use it on their own data, or data acquired during the course.
