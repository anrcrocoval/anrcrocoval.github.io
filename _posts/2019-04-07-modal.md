I have been interviewed for the Modal Project of Biogenouest network of facilities.

Whether it is genomic data, in vitro or in vivo imaging, animal or plant models, data in life sciences are today mostly transformed into silos. The unifying MoDaL (Multi-Scale Data Links) project, carried by the [Biogenouest](www.biogenouest.org) network, aims to decompartmentalize resources and promote moments of exchange and collaborative work around the integration of multi-scale biological data. The purpose of these meetings is to discover the diversity of research profiles in biology and health in the West area of France. In this context I have been [interviewed](https://www.biogenouest.org/article/rencontres-modal-immersion-dans-le-monde-de-la-microscopie-avec-perrine-paul-gilloteaux/) (in French only) by Sofia Strubbba.
