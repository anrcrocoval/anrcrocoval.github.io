I was invited to organize and chair a session at the annual meeting of the French society of Microscopy

{:.no_toc}

This session was a common symposium , gathering both life science and material science. I was pleased to organize it with [Arnaud Demortieres](https://www.lrcs.u-picardie.fr/equipe/permanents/detail/arnaud-demortiere/) from the material field in electron microscopy. 
We decided to call our session "computer guided acquisition, analysis, and interpretation / modeling of microscopy data". 
We had two great invited speakers (Daniel Sage from EPFL and Nelly Pustelnik from Lyon), and 3 excellent selected talk.
