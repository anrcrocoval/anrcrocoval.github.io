We present a point-based registration paradigm, implemented in a free and open source software Ec-CLEM AutoFinder, an extension to EC-CLEM, which presents several advantages. This software is available in the Icy platform.
The only step of our registration workflow which differs between workflows, whatever the dimensionality of data, is the feature extraction step, which can be learned on uncorrelated images. Using an image to image deep learning framework facilitate the task here, but we show that ad-hoc methods can also be faster and efficient.
It includes a method for the selection model of non-rigid transformation, for which the transformation basis is selected according to its physical significance.
