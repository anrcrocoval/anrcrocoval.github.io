The three-dimensional analysis of sample by Serial Block Face Imaging finds its fields of application in the study of micro-anatomy and developmental biology. The concept is to produce a large amount of images directly from the surface of a block in which the sample is included, as it is cut (microtome or cryostat). Serial images are already pre-aligned and allow reconstructing the sample in three dimensions and exploring it in any virtual cutting plane. The MicroPICell platform and the company Kaer Labs are collaborating to develop this technique, by combining a removable camera with an integrated LED excitation source, positioned in front of a conventional microtome or cryostat. From organs included in colored paraffin or frozen in OCT, this technique allowed us to acquire serial images thanks to the fluorescence contrast between the sample and the embedding medium. We could then make a simplified 3D reconstruction of these samples, keeping their structures. Compared to the commercial systems available, this system is inexpensive, requires simple sample preparation and is adaptable for both paraffin and frozen samples.
