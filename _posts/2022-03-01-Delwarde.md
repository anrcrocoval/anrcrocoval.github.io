Degenerative mitral valve dystrophy (MVD) leading to mitral valve prolapse is the most frequent form of MV disease, and there is currently no pharmacological treatment available. The limited understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to MVD limits our ability to identify therapeutic targets. This study aimed to reveal the main pathophysiological pathways involved in MVD via the multimodality imaging and transcriptomic analysis of the new and unique knock-in (KI) rat model for the FilaminA-P637Q (FlnA-P637Q) mutation associated-MVD.
