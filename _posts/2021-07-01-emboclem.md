With my colleagues, mostly from the NEUBIAS network, we organized a virtual course on advanced methods in Bioimage Analysis.

This course got originally funded by EMBO for 2020, but we decided to postpone it and make it virtual in July 2021. We had the great support of the EMBL training team, making the life of organisers so easier. It was a great virtual experience!
