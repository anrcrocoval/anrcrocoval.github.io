The frontiers of bioimaging are currently being pushed toward the integration and correlation of several modalities to tackle biomedical research questions holistically and across multiple scales. Correlated Multimodal Imaging (CMI) gathers information about exactly the same specimen with two or more complementary modalities that—in combination—create a composite and complementary view of the sample (including insights into structure, function, dynamics and molecular composition). The review is in line with major European initiatives, such as COMULIS (CA17121), a COST Action to promote and foster Correlated Multimodal Imaging in Life Sciences.
