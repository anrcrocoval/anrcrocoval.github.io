First release of ecclemv2 and CorrelativeView has been published on icy : [here](http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/plugin/correlativeview) and [here](http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/plugin/ecclemv2).
Note that I have made the choice of creating a new version of ec clem, and both can work without conflict under ICY.

To install a plugin from ICY, simply search the plugin name on the search bar of your local installation of icy.

Some video tutorials are available, more to come.

Code and binary are available on ANR CROCOVAL github.
