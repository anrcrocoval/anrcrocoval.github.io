We have developped [new approaches](https://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/plugin/ecclemv2/) to allow to link cell scale imaging to subcellular sclae imaging, in the context of [the study of reovirus](https://anrcrocoval.github.io/pub/2020/12/01/kounatidis.html) combining super resolution fluorescence and soft x-ray for structural information, or the [validation of the usage of lipid droplets as fiducials](https://anrcrocoval.github.io/pub/2021/06/01/scher.html) for wide field to  Fib Sem under cryo conditions. The workflow developped for Diamond beam line B24 is now used for a lot of different projects commissioning this line. Detailed step by step protocols have been also published.
