## Abstract
Quantification:
In this lecture, we will focus on the extraction of quantitative information from correlated multimodal datasets. We will review the different categories of questions relying on the quantification of correlated multimodal datasets, from the validation of a new imaging modality to the integration of heterogeneous information, based on examples. A particular focus will be done on the confidence estimation on these quantification, and the different possibilities to quantify this confidence in the correlation, in the medical and biological fields.
