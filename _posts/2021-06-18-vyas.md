Correlation of 3D images acquired on different microscopes can be a daunting prospect even for experienced users. This protocol describes steps for registration of images from soft X-ray absorption contrast imaging and super-resolution fluorescence imaging of hydrated biological materials at cryogenic temperatures. Although it is developed for data generated at synchrotron beamlines that offer the above combination of microscopies, it is applicable to all analogous imaging systems where the same area of a sample is examined using successive non-destructive imaging techniques.
