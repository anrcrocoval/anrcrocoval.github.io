## CROss-modal registration in COrrelative Microscopies for VALvulopathy physiological characterisation â€“ CROCOVAL

Correlative microscopies allow to combine different scales of observations and different contents, functional and morphological, based on the large panel of microscopy technologies available for life sciences. Deciphering the fundamental process of cardiac valve dysfunction in particular would greatly benefit from these approaches, because of the heterogeneity of the cellular remodeling processes involved in the development of the disease. In this context, the purpose of this proposal is to reveal this so far unexploited potential of correlative microscopies to unravel fundamental processes causing mitral valve dysfunction by developing adapted data fusion methods. We want to develop an original computer vision approach taking into account the confidence of correlation to acquire and analyse image data from microscopies on an in-house developped animal model of valvulopathy.
We expect that the proposed framework will apply to a larger panel of biomedical studies.

The project is divided in 3 technical and methodological tasks:
Task 1: Development of feature extraction and point based registration, including the creation of a unique database of correlated image;
Task 2: Development of the error estimation framework;
Task 3: Optimization of correlative microscopies acquisition protocols for the study of Mitral Valve Prolapse.

It will be supported and validated by the creation of an original data base, and will allow the development of original and optimized imaging workflows of acquisition.")
